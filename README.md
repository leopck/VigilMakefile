# WatchDog Makefile

Designed with the consideration of using Makefile as the main script to run install dependencies -> compilation -> install -> test

# Workflow that is being used

*Host machine with VSCode and RemoteSSHFS to remotely edit my code on my server
*Client machine running SSH and WatchDog-Makefile to compile my code each time a change happens on the project directory.
